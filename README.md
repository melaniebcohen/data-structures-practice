## Feature Tasks

### Generic List
* Implement a generic `List`.
* Implement `copy` as of method of your `List`.
* Implement `push` as a method of your `List`.
* Implement `pop` as a method of your `List`.

### Linked List
* Implement a *(singly)* `LinkedList`.
* Implement `prepend` as a method of your `LinkedList`.
* Implement `append` as a method of your `LinkedList`.
* Implement `find` as a method of your `LinkedList`

### Stack
* Implement a `Stack`.
* Implement `push` as a method of your `Stack`.
* Implement `pop` as a method of your `Stack`.

### Queue
* Implement a `Queue`.
* Implement `enqueue` as a method of your `Queue`.
* Implement `dequeue` as a method of your `Queue`.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
* Implement a `BinarySearchTree`.
* Implement `insert` as a method of your `BinarySearchTree`.
* Implement `find` as a method of your `BinarySearchTree`.
* Implement `findMax` as a method of your `BinarySearchTree`.
* Implement `findMin` as a method of your `BinarySearchTree`.
* Implement `calcHeight` as a method of your `BinarySearchTree` - this should determine the height of the tree.
* Implement `findNearest` as a method of your `BinarySearchTree` - this should return a node with a value closest to the value you pass it.
